      "content": ["Moldovan President Maia Sandu gives a speech in Paris in November 2022.\r\nCopyright YOAN VALAT/AFP\r\nBy Ioulia Poukhli\r\nPublished on 17/02/2023 - 21:58 GMT+1\r\nShare\r\nComments\r\nMoldova’s constitution forces it to remain neutral or use its military forces, but how long can the status quo last as fighting rages on next door in Ukraine?\r\nMoldova closed its airspace for two hours this week. The reason, according to local media, was \"security considerations\" amid Russia's invasion of Moldova's neighbouring Ukraine and accusations voiced by President Maia Sandu that the Kremlin intended to seize power in the Republic.\r\n\r\nArticle 11 of the constitution of Moldova states: \"The Republic proclaims its permanent neutrality, [...] does not allow the deployment of military forces of other states on its territory.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing Russian military action in the south of Ukraine in 2022 near the Moldovan border and with the prospect of Russian missiles violating the Republic's airspace, should we expect its foreign policy stance to change?\r\n\r\nWill Moldova eventually follow in Ukraine's footsteps and reconsider its neutral non-aligned status in favour of Euro-Atlantic integration and forming a strategic partnership with the European Union and the United States?\r\n\r\n\r\nMoldova and NATO: A short history\r\nRelations with NATO began in 1992 when Moldova joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. In 1997, this forum replaced the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, which brings together allies and partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic region.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nBilateral cooperation began when Moldova joined the Partnership for Peace program in 1994. In 2006, the Republic agreed to its first two-year Individual Partnership Action Plan. \r\n\r\nAt the alliance summit in Wales in September 2014, allied leaders offered increased support, advice and assistance to Moldova as part of the new Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative. An individual package of measures was agreed upon in June 2015.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Moldovan government, a NATO Civilian Liaison Office was established in Chisinau in December 2017 to promote practical cooperation and help support reforms in the country. \r\n\r\nRelated\r\nUkraine war: How can NATO ramp up munitions production?\r\nBut according to Marie Dumoulin, a former career diplomat and today director of the Wider Europe Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, Moldova would have a hard time joining the alliance because of its stance on neutrality. \r\n\r\n\"Because of the neutral status enshrined in the constitution, the country cannot be a member of any military alliance,\" she said. \r\n\r\n\"Therefore, even if Moldova has maintained and continues to maintain relations with NATO, it is not a member of this alliance or of the Collective Security Treaty Organization formed around Russia. \r\n\r\nRelated\r\nAs NATO countries dither over tanks, Ukraine's soldiers shiver in trenches under constant fire\r\n\"At present, it has no desire to join any of these alliances.

We are seeing, for example, pro-Russian forces trying to destabilise the country politically through paid protests which quickly subsided when the oligarchs that fled Moldova were put on the sanctions lists and their money flows were restricted,\" Natalia Gavrilița said.\r\n\r\n\"We are seeing cyber attacks. We've had the biggest cyber attacks in 2022 in the history of our country, and we are seeing bomb threats.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of the situation in Moldova will depend on the evolution of the war in Ukraine. We see the brave Ukrainians being very resilient and fighting for the security not only of their country, but also for the security of Moldova and for wider for the values that we as Europeans profess,\" she added.\r\n\r\nGavrilița spoke to Euronews during a visit to Brussels to take part in the seventh EU-Moldova Association Council, taking place just months after the country was granted EU candidate status alongside Ukraine.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nShe said that the country's security is highly vulnerable to events unfolding in neighbouring Ukraine, with the war putting Moldova's economy, energy security and social stability under great strain.\r\n\r\nMoldova is high on the list of at-risk states, as Russia has numerous openings to exploit its economic and energy dependence. Before the war, the small country imported all of its gas from Russia but Gazprom has since severely reduced deliveries.\r\n\r\n\"We were expecting growth of 5% in 2022 and instead we saw a decrease in economic growth by 5.5%. We have very high inflation and for example, the tariff for gas went up seven times, the tariff for electricity went up three times,\" Gavrilița told Euronews.\r\n\r\n\"And although we have targeted social assistance programmes, the bills that people are seeing have increased dramatically,\" she said, adding that wages have not adjusted accordingly.  \r\n\r\nThe EU Commission proposed €145 million in new funding just last week and said it will continue to support the country's economy and energy security.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria remains a source of concern as the war is still ongoing.\r\n\r\nThe narrow strip of land almost 200 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide is located between the Dniester River and Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine. It split from Moldova in 1992 but is not recognised as a sovereign state by the international community or even by Russia.\r\n\r\n\"We consider the situation in our separatist Transnistria region fragile but stable,\" the prime minister said. \r\n\r\nGavrilita also told Euronews there is increased illegal migration using the Ukrainian conflict as a transit route or using Moldova as a transit country. These numbers are not very big but she stressed the importance to ensure that they don't grow and they don't turn into a phenomenon."],

      "content": ["A girl walks past an emblem of the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in Tiraspol, the capital of the breakaway region of Transnistria, November 2021\r\nCopyright AP Photo/Euronews\r\nBy Claudiu Degeratu, Security expert\r\nPublished on 06/02/2023 - 16:49 GMT+1 •Updated 17:02\r\nShare\r\nComments\r\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not represent in any way the editorial position of Euronews.\r\nRussia has blackmailed the eastern European country of 2.6 million for over three decades. Now, Chișinău's pro-European turn should be greeted with enthusiasm, security expert Claudiu Degeratu argues.\r\nA miracle is about to happen in Moldova. The former Soviet republic, today a candidate country for European Union membership, is about to fully break from Moscow's grasp and redefine its strategic identity in challenging times.\r\n\r\nDespite the Kremlin's not-so-veiled threats of expanding its aggression against Ukraine to the eastern European country of 2.6 million people, Chișinău has remained unmoved, surprising many. \r\n\r\nYet, after all, Moldovans have been acutely aware of Moscow's malignant behaviour ever since the 1992 war in Transnistria brought on a new invention in terms of Russia's control in the post-Soviet space.\r\n\r\nA frozen conflict in a grey, militarily controlled breakaway area within the territory of a state forcing it to declare itself as neutral allowed Russia to maintain a foothold further westwards in Europe for more than three decades. \r\n\r\nDespite that, except for Romania, Poland and the Baltic countries, the rest of the Europeans — if and when they paid attention to Moldova — saw the situation there as stable. Complicated, but stable.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nAnd so, for decades, nothing seemed to impose Moldova on the European agenda, an issue that could be at least partially explained by the stereotypical attitude towards the former republics of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThen the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 changed everything.\r\n\r\nMoldova's neutrality: Moscow's gilded cage\r\nRussia's war in Ukraine is, in many ways, also about the Republic of Moldova. In 2014, Moscow's designs were not so evident because Russian military aggression in the Donbas and Crimea had the element of surprise. Kyiv's forces were quickly defeated, and the active military phase ended promptly.\r\n\r\nJust like in Chișinău, the political elites in Kyiv did not prepare for war at the time and had no plans to defend against Russia, forcing Ukraine to a stalemate, an echo of Moldova's political and military neutrality. \r\n\r\nThe illegally annexed territories were quickly militarised, following the same blueprint. For decades, thousands of Russian soldiers in Transnistria — officially on a \"peacekeeping\" mission — were there to remind everyone what would happen if the country's leaders were to change their minds or earlier agreements or fight back.\r\n\r\nLast year's all-out war of aggression, however, made Russia a pariah and emboldened the likes of Moldova enough to distance itself away from Moscow.\r\n\r\nThis led to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov menacing Chișinău in recent days and labelling it as the West's new \"anti-Russian project\". \r\n\r\nBELA SZANDELSZKY/AP\r\nSoldiers of the Transnistrian Army are holding red flags during the Victory Day parade in Tiraspol, Transnistria, in 2005. BELA SZANDELSZKY/AP\r\nThe eternal head of Russian diplomacy was probably spurred on by the prospect that Moscow would permanently lose its ability to blackmail it on matters such as domestic and foreign policy, energy, and economic assistance.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nFor years, Moscow behaved like a demanding, brash teacher on the topics of neutrality for countries like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, and Lavrov felt good in his dual role as a referee and power-broker for pro-Russian groups in these countries.\r\n\r\nIn Moldova, the issue of neutrality and disarmament became taboo. Otherwise, Moldovan politicians risked being labelled as enemies of Moldova's statehood, pro-unionists looking for Romania to swallow up its eastern neighbour, or simply pro-NATO supporters.\r\n\r\nSense of safety from control and a carbon copy of Kremlin's corruption\r\nBut how was the assumed position of neutrality justified, considering the presence of Russian troops on the sovereign territory of Moldova?\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no clear answer, I am inclined to believe that for some 30 years, Moscow managed to achieve adequate control over a significant part of the domestic elites in Chișinău.\r\n\r\nThe pro-Moscow parties in Moldova received the Kremlin's support in exchange for asserting a pro-Russian and anti-European identity. Economic dependence mattered just as much.\r\n\r\nMoreover, full control of the defence, security and intelligence services offered a sense of safety to any pro-Russian party chief in the Republic of Moldova.\r\n\r\nCorruption which has plagued the country since its independence, came as a mimicry, a carbon copy of the practices in the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nWith all that stacked against the government in Chișinău, even the slightest change in course would inevitably result in trouble.\r\n\r\nVADIM DENISOV/AFP\r\nPeople carry a Russian flag (C) and a flag with a portait of Russia's President Vladimir Putin reading \"We are for Putin!\" in Tiraspol, in 2014 VADIM DENISOV/AFP\r\nIt was enough for a president like Maia Sandu to challenge Moscow's Russophile and anti-Europeanist narrative with a speech about the country's pro-EU desires, anticorruption initiatives and overall reform to rattle Moscow to the point it became nervous and threatening.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nMoreover, discussions over Moldova's continued neutrality policy became particularly worrisome for Moscow when the pro-European political parties squarely sided with Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIn turn, it used Moldova's energy dependence on Russia to create internal conflict.\r\n\r\nThe street demonstrations of the pro-Russian parties in Chisinau were, in essence, destabilisation attempts.\r\n\r\nMost Europeans were not aware of these \"bitter fruits\" of Moldovan neutrality and would remain in the dark if Russia had not invaded Ukraine. \r\n\r\nEven those who had known about these issues for years were not clear on the scale until the fluid strategic context created by the Russian aggression in Ukraine came to the fore.\r\n\r\nNow, it is time to do more to help the country find its way out of its quagmires. The international support platform for Moldova, run by France, Germany, and Romania, is a perfect start.\r\n\r\nEuropean integration and strategic autonomy are the solutions to Russia's pressure\r\nThe war in Ukraine will fundamentally change the paradigm of defence in Europe, and the Republic of Moldova has a choice.\r\n\r\nMoreover, after a year of war in the neighbouring state, Chișinău's balance sheet of honest politicians vs those influenced or outright controlled by Moscow is not to the liking of the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the courageous decisions taken by President Sandu and the pro-European government led by Natalia Gavrilița have shifted this balance even further.\r\n\r\nThat has led your average Moldovans to begin to see the gilded lattices of the cage of supposed neutrality designed to suit Moscow and supported by Lavrov and others at the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nThe examples of Sweden and Finland, authentic neutral states resilient to any significant evolution in the security environment despite Russia's proximity, gave Moldova an essential lesson on how to respond to Moscow's blackmail, especially when it's done openly.\r\n\r\nMoscow's paternalistic neutrality trumpeted against Moldova cashes in on the fear of war, the fear of the costs of energy dependence, and internal instability.\r\n\r\nDANIEL MIHAILESCU/DANIEL MIHAILESCU\r\nA married couple poses at The Triumph Arch next to Moldovan flag on Stefan Cel Mare street in Chisinau city on October 8, 2013 DANIEL MIHAILESCU/DANIEL MIHAILESCU\r\nMoldova is about to discover that, while neutrality can remain a constitutional principle in the face of these dramatic changes, salvation can only come in the form of European integration and genuine strategic autonomy.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nFurthermore, the defence strategy of the Republic of Moldova and its armed forces have become the most critical priorities. Moldova needs modern defence capabilities, assistance programs and defence resources.\r\n\r\nIf this were to fail, neutrality without ensuring strategic autonomy would continue to be just another sophisticated way for the country to remain in the Russian imperial periphery.\r\n\r\nThe Moldovan miracle could be one of the European success stories.\r\n\r\nNow is the time for Europe to believe in it.

        "Russia on Tuesday (7 November) formally withdrew from a landmark security treaty which limited key categories of conventional armed forces, blaming the United States for undermining post-Cold War security with the enlargement of the NATO military alliance.",
        "The 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), signed a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, placed verifiable limits on categories of conventional military equipment that NATO and the then-Warsaw Pact could deploy.",
        "The treaty was designed to prevent either side of the Cold War from amassing forces for a swift offensive against the other in Europe, but was unpopular in Moscow as it blunted the Soviet Union’s advantage in conventional weapons.",
        "Russia suspended participation in the treaty in 2007 and halted active participation in 2015. More than a year after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin in May signed a decree denounced the pact.",
        "Russia’s foreign ministry said Russia had formally withdrawn from the pact at midnight – and that the treaty was now “history”.",
        "“The CFE Treaty was concluded at the end of the Cold War, when the formation of a new architecture of global and European security based on cooperation seemed possible, and appropriate attempts were made,” the ministry said.",
        "Russia said the US push for enlargement of NATO had led to alliance countries “openly circumventing” the treaty’s group restrictions, and added that the admission of Finland into NATO and Sweden’s application meant the treaty was dead.",
        "“Even the formal preservation of the CFE Treaty has become unacceptable from the point of view of Russia’s fundamental security interests,” the ministry said, noting that the United States and its allies did not ratify the updated 1999 CFE.",
        "The war in Ukraine has triggered the worst crisis in Moscow’s relations with the West since the depths the Cold War. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said over the weekend that relations with the United States were below zero.",
        "After Russia announced its intention to exit the treaty this year, NATO condemned the decision, saying it undermined Euro-Atlantic security.",
        "“Russia has for many years not complied with its CFE obligations,”NATO said in June. “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and Belarus’ complicity, is contrary to the objectives of the CFE Treaty.”",
        "The United States and its allies had linked ratification of the adapted 1999 CFE to Russia fulfilling commitments on Georgia and Moldova to withdraw its troops from these countries.",
        "Russia said that linkage was wrong.",
        "In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia and still occupies 20% of its territory. Recently Russia signed a deal for a permanent naval base on the Black Sea coast of the occupied Georgian region of Abkhazia.",
        "Russia has signed a deal for a permanent naval base on the Black Sea coast…",
        "Russia still keeps troops in Transnistria, part of the territory of Moldova, a EU candidate country.",
        "In 2011, in response to the Russian “suspension”, which Washington said was not legal under the treaty, the United States and NATO ceased implementing it in relation to Russia, according to theState Department.",
        "“Russia’s ‘suspension’ of Treaty implementation since 2007 has seriously eroded the Treaty’s verifiability, decreased transparency, and undermined the cooperative approach to security that have been core elements of the NATO-Russia relationship and European security for more than two decades,” the State Department said in 2020.",

Moldova’s presidentMaia Sandu’s pro-Europeanand reformist credentials were important in this achievement. Sandu has made it her goal to take Moldova into the EU by 2030.",
        "But in westernEurope, too, there has been an attitude shift: even governments traditionally sceptical about EU enlargement, such as the French, have, at least for the time being, embraced Moldova’s path to European integration.",
        "Only a year ago, Moldova relied on Russia for100% of its natural gas imports. Now, that figure is down to 0%. Energy prices remain unaffordably high for many Moldovans, but it is no longer a security threat.

Moldova and Ukraine have synchronised their grids with the EU’s and built interconnections with neighbouring Romania. Without electricity powered by Russian gas, Moldova would temporarily struggle, but it would survive.",
        "And Russia knows it. It also knows that its invasion of Ukraine has upended Transnistria’s economy, casting doubt over this puppetregion’s political future. Transnistria survives on the electricity it sells to Moldova, powered by Russian gas that it gets for free. Russia maintains a massive ammunition depot and a1,500-strong military forcein Transnistria, but only about 70 of these soldiers are actually Russian. The rest are Transnistrians with dual Moldovan and Russian passports: for most, their role in Russian forces is just a job.",

Why accelerate a political process that would distract Moldova from its EU reform path, while possibly triggering aRussian-backed coupor overt military response? Chisinau wants the eventual reintegration of Transnistria, but wants it to happen through the Moldovisation of Transnistria, not the other way around.",
        "All that said, Moldova’s security situation remains precarious, with a tiny and underequipped army facing a persistent Russian threat.The country’s economic challenge is almost as daunting.Lacking a strong industrial base, Moldova does not have an obvious path out of its unwanted ranking asEurope’s poorest country. Even before the war, with an energy crisis that caused inflation to soar, annual income per head averaged at less than $4,000, compared with the EU average of $33,000. Thecost of living crisisexplains Sandu’s waning popularity and could still bring her down in elections next year.",

The streets are emptier than Chisinau’s and I spotted buildings damaged by aRussian drone attack.

The idea that Paris is only concerned with the [West African] Sahel region no longer holds water,” said Gesine Weber, research analyst and fellow in Paris office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\r\n\r\n“French commitment in Moldova and Armenia also confirms the changing perception of security threats. They come at a time when France wants to signal these countries are part of Europe's security order, which nobody believes can be constructed with Russia,” she added. \r\n\r\nFrance, like other large military powers, has often used arms exports as a diplomatic tool.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after Macron launched his European Political Community — a forum created in response to the Ukraine invasion that gathers EU and non-EU European countries — France’s political push is now translating into actual weapons contracts and defense cooperation agreements that include French military training and help to beef up air defenses.\r\n\r\nTerritorial integrity\r\nMoldova and Armenia \"are not in the EU, but are part of the European geographical area, and are relatively fragile due to certain attempts at destabilization,” said a French government official, speaking on condition of being granted anonymity because they’re not allowed to speak publicly.   \r\n\r\nBoth countries have Russian troops stationed on their territories — in Moldova's case against its will in the breakaway region of Transnistria, and in Armenia's because of deals intended to bolster its security against regional threats following the fall of the USSR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacron and Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev visit the Gur-e-Amir mausoleum | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images\r\nBut now, the two countries are seeking closer ties and integration with Europe, while actively struggling against Moscow's influence. They're also both boosting defense spending.\r\n\r\nFor French officials, what links the two is that both face a potential challenge to their territorial integrity — from Russia in Moldova and from neighboring Azerbaijan in Armenia.\r\n\r\n“France has the will to help countries that could be threatened by external intrusions protect their borders and sovereignty,” the French government official said.\r\n\r\nIn October, Paris announced it would begin selling weaponry to Armenia — despite the country still technically being a member of the CSTO alliance.\r\n\r\nThe move came just weeks after Azerbaijan launched a lightning offensive to take control of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh; almost all of the enclave's ethnic Armenian population has since fled.\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan denies it has plans to attack Armenia and has accused France of perpetuating \"neo-colonialism\" and \"Islamophobia\" with its strategy in the South Caucasus. The country has since set up a working group tasked with “the complete elimination” of what it claims are French imperial ambitions, inviting representatives from French overseas territories like Martinique, Guyana, New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacron wants France to become an alternative to Russia and China in Central Asia | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images\r\nWith the failure of Russian peacekeepers to hold the line against Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia is shifting to the West. It recognizes the Rome Statute that would oblige it to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he sets foot in Armenia again and has invited U.S. troops to hold joint exercises with the Armenian military.\r\n\r\nMoldova, meanwhile, has hundreds of Russian troops based in the unrecognized breakaway region of Transnistria. The country is an aspiring candidate to join the European Union, and has received significant support from the bloc — including France — in countering Moscow's influence.\r\n\r\n“Both Moldova and Armenia are not in a situation of attack, but rather of defense,\" said Anne Genetet, a French lawmaker from the National Assembly’s defense committee whose constituency includes French citizens living in both countries.\r\n\r\nLessons from Ukraine\r\nFor now, French contracts with both Armenia and Moldova cover mainly air defense systems.\r\n\r\nThe package of radars and missiles that have been discussed publicly will be useful to Armenia “because they’re defensive weapons against [drones] — there is a clear imbalance in terms of how Azerbaijan uses drones and this is how they’ve won so easily in recent conflicts. Armenia needs to regain control of the skies,\" said Tigrane Yégavian, professor of international relations at Schiller International University in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe French government sold Thales-made Ground Master 200 radars to Armenia and Moldova — the Ukrainian army is also a client — which can detect helicopters, cruise missiles, rockets and drones, among other threats. They're also looking into whether to purchase Mistral air defense systems made by MBDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan this year launched a lightning offensive to take control of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh | Narek Aleksanyan/EFE via EPA\r\nThe focus on air defense and training — France has pledged to share know-how with both armed forces — is a direct consequence of lessons drawn from Ukraine, according to the German Marshall Fund’s Weber. \r\n\r\n“One of the main issues in Ukraine is that Ukrainians needed training to best use the systems delivered to them,” she said, adding that training started too late. In Moldova and Armenia, \"the idea is now to have armies capable of using Western systems.”\r\n\r\nVlad Lupan, Moldova's former permanent representative to the U.N. and now a professor at New York University, said France's blend of military and political support has been invaluable for his country as it works to reduce Russian influence and modernize its armed forces after decades of neglect.\r\n\r\n\"Current events in Ukraine and the greater independence France is seeking for itself within European affairs and NATO gives it an opportunity to become a supporter of the Moldova-NATO army and security reform,\" he said, \"thus playing a more important role in a country that can serve as an example of European integration success if it's done correctly.\""],

      "content": ["The country’s breakaway Transnistria region is complicating Moldova’s attempts to set up a carbon pricing scheme.\r\n\r\nCopy Link\r\nFree article usually reserved for subscribers\r\nMOLDOVA-TRANSNISTRIA-UKRAINE-RUSSIA-CONFLICT\r\nAround 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in Transnistria | Daniel Mihailescu/AFP via Getty Images\r\nAugust 24, 2023 11:00 am CET\r\nBy Federica Di Sario\r\nMoldova wants to introduce its own carbon tax to keep pace with the European Union's climate legislation — but the effort is creating tensions with its Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, home to most of the country's heavy industry.\r\n\r\nThe EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Measure (CBAM) is a border tax aimed at keeping bloc's companies competitive by ensuring that rivals also pay a carbon price. It targets six carbon-intensive sectors highly exposed to international trade: aluminum, cement, iron and steel, electricity, hydrogen and fertilizers. Its transitional phase launches on October and goes fully into effect in 2026.\r\n\r\nThat's a big potential problem for Moldova, and especially Transnistria, which is a large exporter of iron and steel to the EU. A study by Carnegie Europe found the CBAM would \"most likely lead to unemployment and reduced wages\" and could put up to 2 percent of Moldova's employment at risk.\r\n\r\nThe carbon border tax is linked to the price of permits under the EU's cap and trade Emissions Trading System — currently about €90 per ton. The way non-EU countries can avoid the levy is to have their own carbon pricing schemes — something Moldova plans to do by 2025.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Moldova has no clue how to ensure that Transnistria, a region plagued by corruption and which does not recognize the government's authority, would implement complex policies such as carbon measurement, reporting and verification.\r\n\r\n“First, how can we monitor such a market? How do you then check it and get the reporting on these emissions?” Carolina Novac, Moldova's state secretary for energy, told POLITICO. “How do we enforce such a mechanism both internally but also in Transnistria?” \r\n\r\nAround 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in Transnistria — part of a frozen conflict dating back to the fall of the USSR. The region is also home to several Soviet-era industrial plants, which generate over half of its GDP through exports.\r\n\r\nPolicymakers in Chişinău can estimate and monitor emissions from the region “to a certain extent,” said Péter Pozgai, a governance expert at the Energy Community, an organization that aims to better integrate the EU's neighbors into the bloc's energy policy.\r\n\r\nBut Moldova will have difficulty forcing the enclave to implement a CO2 pricing scheme, according to Igor Munteanu, a former Moldovan diplomat who served as the country's ambassador to the U.S. and now heads the Institute for Development and Social Initiatives in Chișinău. \r\n\r\n“It is not feasible to impose anything today because Transnistria is an occupied territory,” Munteanu said.\r\n\r\nWith or without you\r\nIf Moldova wants to set up a carbon pricing scheme in time to comply with the CBAM, the only option is to leave Transnistria behind — at least for the time being, according to Novac.\r\n\r\nThat would lead to the awkward situation of having the country's highest carbon-emitting region remaining outside the scheme — which would undermine any effort to spur its decarbonization.\r\n\r\n\r\nA soldier and a woman walk past the headquarters of the Operative Group of the Russian Troops in the town of Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria | Sergei Gapon/AFP via Getty Images\r\nIn the longer term, Transnistria will have to agree to be part of the carbon pricing scheme to keep selling to the EU, said Novac. If “they want to export their goods to the EU, they’ll need to have their carbon reflected in their products,\" she said.\r\n\r\nPozgai echoed that position.\r\n\r\n“Companies … that would seek to maintain this trade relationship would clearly have to comply with the EU existent and future climate legislation and policies,” he said.\r\n\r\nLast year, over 60 percent of Transnistria's exports — mainly iron and steel — went to the EU, particularly to Romania, Poland, Germany, Slovenia and Italy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tiraspol is at odds with Chișinău, the two entities are entwined.\r\n\r\nTransnistrian businesses exporting to the EU — including the Moldova Steel Works (MMZ), the enclave's third-largest taxpayer — are dependent on the Moldovan government issuing environmental permits, meaning “Chişinău can and does influence the work dynamics of companies from Transnistria,” said Anatolii Dirun, an assistant professor at the Tiraspol School of Political Science..\r\n\r\nMoldova also benefits as Transnistria gets free Russian gas — which allows it to supply around two-thirds of Moldova’s electricity consumption.\r\n\r\n“The MMZ agreement is part of a package deal between Tiraspol and Chișinău, in which Moldova issues the environmental permit and Tiraspol supplies electricity to [the rest of the country],” Dirun said.\r\n\r\nTransnistria's government did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nHigh costs\r\nSetting up a carbon price in Moldova also risks being painfully expensive.\r\n\r\nNovac is concerned about the spillover effects on the country's shaky economy, something she communicated to the European Commission’s climate department during a June visit to Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe EU's ETS has been in the works for almost two decades, “so you absorb the shocks over time. In our case, we’ll have to have a scheme in place by the end of 2025,” she said.\r\n\r\nAdapting to the EU's carbon trading system risks turning into a \"big impediment\" for poorer countries, said Sinan Ülgen, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Europe think tank.\r\n\r\n\"Their transition is going to be enormously costly,\" he said, pointing to the limited number of funding options available as well as the gap between the imminent kickoff of the CBAM and the lengthy time needed by industry to adapt.\r\n\r\nNovac predicted that some Moldovan businesses will \"probably [go] bust.”\r\n\r\nShe wants Moldova to have greater access to EU funding — including the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the Just Transition Fund; currently those are only available to member countries. Instead, Moldova has access to other schemes like the much smaller regional EU4Climate program. The EU shot down an effort to redistribute CBAM revenues to affected countries.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission declined to comment on Novac's ideas."],

Revolutionary change was sweeping Central Europe; Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost and perestroika were in full swing; and within three months of the United Sates navy’s goodwill visit, the Berlin Wall was torn down.\r\n\r\nBut as so often happened in the past, the Black Sea is now at the center of conflict once more.\r\n\r\nDubbed the “Inhospitable Sea” by the ancient Greeks — not only for the challenge in navigating its squalls and tempests but also the pugilistic tribes populating its shores — there have been few centuries when the Black Sea wasn’t marked by war. And with the conflict in Ukraine raging on, these waters have become inhospitable once again — and are getting more so by the day — as both Russia and Ukraine determinedly deny each other control or safe passage in yet another front in this grinding war.\r\n\r\nIn the first few months after Russia invaded, Ukrainians feared Moscow would order an amphibious assault on its coastline to help seize Odesa and other ports, aiming to link Russian-occupied parts of the Donbas with the breakaway statelet of Transnistria in Moldova, denying Ukraine any access to the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nBut Ukraine managed to prevent this from happening last year, firing off missiles that sunk the landing ship the Saratov, as well as two others. And in April 2022, it humiliated Russia by sinking its flagship Moskva, the pride of the Black Sea fleet and the most powerful warship in the region.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, Ukraine has continued to harry Russia’s naval forces ever since, using both inexpensive aerial drones and innovative sea drones to swarm, target and strike — including warships at anchor at Sevastopol, the Russian fleet’s home base, where they damaged two ships, a minesweeper and, more importantly, the Admiral Makarov frigate last year. Kyiv has also repeated such attacks further afield on ports like Novorossiysk where, just last week, a Ukrainian drone left a damaged Russian warship listing perilously.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t the way Russia thought the maritime conflict would go. After all, at the start of the war they had a powerful fleet of more than 40 surface warships, plus support and auxiliaries and five Kilo-class submarines. Ukraine, meanwhile, had already lost most of its naval assets when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. It had a diminutive fleet, comprising a dozen patrol and coastal boats, and an amphibious landing vessel. It also had a frigate but was forced to scuttle it in March last year.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, much as it was on land so it has been at sea, as Ukraine has proven an inventive, daring David, outmaneuvering a leaden Goliath. Kyiv has deprived Russia’s fleet of strategic initiative, forcing it back on its heels and coercing Russian commanders — much to their frustration — to withdraw warships from Ukraine’s near coastal waters. Moscow has also reportedly moved its submarines from Russian-occupied Crimea to southern Russia.\r\n\r\n“Pushing Russia’s submarines out of Sevastopol to Novorossiysk has been a remarkable feat for Ukraine, especially as it has little in the way of anti-submarine capabilities,” Daniel Fiott — head of the defense and statecraft program at the Brussels School of Governance’s Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy — noted last year.\r\n\r\nHowever, Russia ultimately has the upper hand. It can still fire off sea-launched Kalibr Cruise missiles, and it has the tactical reach to continue to blockade and deter civilian cargo vessels loaded with Ukrainian wheat, maize, barley, corn and sunflower from daring to sail the Black Sea — especially now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has sunk the grain deal, which allowed more than 32 million tons of food commodities to be exported to 45 countries across three continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nin April 2022, Ukraine humiliated Russia by sinking its flagship Moskva, the pride of the Black Sea fleet and the most powerful warship in the region | Vasily Batanov/AFP via Getty Images\r\nSo, with Russia actively threatening to sink any civilian vessel heading to Ukrainian ports, as they could be carrying military supplies, Ukraine is now pushing back and trying to demonstrate it, too, can play a game of brinkmanship — hence the recent drone strike on a Russian oil tanker in the Kerch Strait as part of the ongoing effort to punish Moscow and make it rethink the grain initiative.\r\n\r\nEnding the deal has “untied Kyiv’s hands,” said Ukrainian military analyst Roman Svytan, adding that the frequency of attacks on Russian ships will likely increase in a bid to get the Kremlin to agree on a renewal.\r\n\r\nWhether Moscow will reenter the initiative, however, remains to be seen. Putin’s unsubtle game is to barter a deal revival for some sort of sanctions relief, using the threat of higher food prices and starvation in Africa and the Global South to get his way. He may also hope to coerce Ukrainian leaders into making concessions to allow for peace talks, then use African leaders’ frustration to cajole Kyiv into negotiations.\r\n\r\nBut Ukraine and its allies are unlikely to cave to Russia’s blackmail — they can’t afford to give into extortion. And on the diplomatic front, Ukraine is trying to strike back and persuade the leaders of the Global South that they’re being used by a Kremlin that really doesn’t care who it starves."],

You can unsubscribe at any time.\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin has been using frozen conflicts on the fringes of the Russian empire for decades, thawing and refreezing them to suit its immediate objectives: we’ve seen enough of this tactic in Donbass, Transnistria, and South Ossetia. In the same vein, the conflict in Karabakh is Russia’s key to the Southern Caucasus and - indirectly - to Europe. That is why the US and the EU must join forces to broker a lasting peace in the region and not allow Putin to play his old tricks. But unfortunately, so far Russia has had a field day in Karabakh.\r\n\r\nKarabakh is internationally recognised Azerbaijani territory with a separatist enclave, populated by Armenians. This area is controlled by the Russian military contingent operating under the guise of peacekeepers, and there are no Azerbaijanis living there – they were all forcefully expelled 30 years ago.  Armenia does not recognise the enclave as a part of its territory and has no territorial claims against Azerbaijan in this area.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent developments in the Karabakh crisis concerns humanitarian corridors to supply food and necessities to the people of the enclave. On 15 July, Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, announced Baku’s plans to establish a new route to deliver humanitarian supplies to Karabakh through the Azerbaijani city of Aghdam. Why? — Well, since December 2022 the separatist leadership of the enclave has been claiming that “Artsakh” (the Armenian name for Karabakh) suffers from total hunger and humanitarian disaster.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only road linking the enclave to Armenia is the Lachin road, controlled by the Russian military. This road allows free movement of transport and humanitarian goods, and separatists apparently have an interest in ensuring that this corridor continues to link the enclave's capital, Khankendi (called Stepanakert in Armenian), with Armenia. It is clear why; as Baku has repeatedly stated, the Lachin corridor is used for the transfer of military equipment and troops. It is not used for humanitarian goods to alleviate alleged “hunger”.\r\n\r\nThe plans to open an alternative route that would be controlled by the Azerbaijani authorities threatens the “status quo”. That is why on 18 July, representatives of the pro-Russian movement the \"Front for Security and Development of Artsakh\" blocked the road through Aghdam to Khankendi with concrete blocks.\r\n\r\nWhatever satisfies hunger is good food, according to an old Chinese proverb. Perhaps we should qualify this by adding that whatever road brings food is a good road, provided that it is alleviating real hunger.\r\n\r\nAn investigation by Ukrainian MP Volodymyr Kreidenko casts doubt on this narrative. He ordered the delivery of meat and fish dishes, cheeses, desserts and other delicacies for several corporate parties in Khankendi - and did not receive a single refusal. All of this was for consumption in the \"starving\" enclave. Simultaneously, the social networks of the residents of Karabakh were full of photos of feasts and check-ins from restaurants, and the people in these photos did not look as if they were under-nourished either.\r\n\r\nOn 27 June this was also acknowledged by Shirak Torosyan, an MP from the ruling party of Armenia: \"There is no hunger in Artsakh, there is no need to thicken the colours.” This statement is in line with the position of Yerevan and the majority of the Armenian population, who are tired of the conflict with Azerbaijan and the dependence on Russia that it brings.\r\n\r\nIt is in Armenia's interest to change its course to a pro-Western one not in words but in deeds. This is also good for Azerbaijan, creating prerequisites for mutually beneficial co-operation and laying the groundwork for economic growth. The only power for which the end of the conflict means defeat and loss of leverage in the region is the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nThe blocking of the Aghdam-Khankendi road was organised by the \"Front for Security and Development of Artsakh\", created by Putin's emissary, ex-head of \"Artsakh\" Ruben Vardanyan. This only goes to show that the Kremlin is determined to destabilise the region - despite the fact that the other two parties actually seek peace. Putin is using the same playbook in Karabakh as he did in Ukraine, South Ossetia and Transnistria before. Russia's policy has led Armenian separatists in Karabakh to favour the indefinite stay of the Russian military contingent and a referendum on joining the Russian Federation. This all sounds very familiar, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\nYou may wonder how these developments in the South Caucasus concern Europe and why the EU should pay attention to them in an energy crisis exacerbated by a cost of living crisis. The simple answer is that lasting peace in the region means opening new transport corridors for energy supplies from Azerbaijan and the movement of goods from China and other Asian countries, bypassing Russia. This would put an end to Russia's energy blackmail and make it cheaper to import goods to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe active participation of the European Union and the United States in the negotiation process between Baku and Yerevan and the stabilisation of the situation in the region will deprive Putin of his position in the South Caucasus. This will also contribute to the final re-orientation of Armenia, freed from the bullying of its \"big brother\", towards the West."],

You can unsubscribe at any time.\r\n\r\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and partly due to a decreased interest in the West, Russia has managed to become a regional superpower, exerting its influence over the other post-Soviet countries, writes James Wilson.\r\n\r\nRussian attempts to cling to “past glory” has involved making other republics bend to its will and interests. Some tried to oppose it. Prime examples are Georgia, which Russia invaded in 2008, and Ukraine, chunks of which Russia occupied in 2014 before invading again in 2022. With Georgia’s mass protests in Tbilisi making today’s headlines across the world, over a controversial bill that the Georgian government it is trying to pass, Russia has once again reverted to its strategy of destabilisation and issuing official threats.\r\n\r\nThe proposed bill, named “Transparency of Foreign Funding”, would require non-governmental organisations in Georgia to register as \"agents of foreign influence\" if the funds they receive from abroad amount to more than 20% of their total revenue. The protests against this proposed bill have alarmed many in the Kremlin and its propaganda outlets, leading to open threats against Georgia from officials such as Dmitry Peskov - Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office and Presidential Press Secretary. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia released several statements threatening Georgia if the protests were to continue by reminding everyone what Russia did in Ukraine in 2014. Yet another curious source of threats to Georgia, with explicit calls for nuclear strikes, came from the editor-in-chief of RT news, the Kremlin’s largest propagandist media outlet - Margarita Simonyan.\r\n\r\nAnother conflict in which Russia is meddling in the Caucasus can have immense consequences but it is not being adequately covered by the media. This conflict is taking place in the Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and is as volatile as ever.\r\n\r\nThe Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 was prompted by a very familiar “casus belli” - “the protection of Russian-aligned people in the territory of a foreign country”. This excuse has been used by Russian official statements in several other territories as well, creating breakaway republics some of which were promptly recognised by Russia and its allies, offering them military protection by intervening in any armed conflicts these “autonomous republics” would be embroiled in. Whether it be creating Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, or Transnistria in parts of Moldova, or the most infamous example - the Donbass republics on Ukrainian territory.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “Nagorno-Karabakh” region, known in the Azeri language as Karabakh, is a UN-recognised Azerbaijani territory. There is a small separatist enclave populated by ethnic Armenians situated in the area. It was not recognised even by Armenia, which supports it. Since the 2020 war, in which Azerbaijan liberated much of this territory in that region after 30 years of Armenian occupation, Russian “peacekeepers” have been deployed to the region to stabilise the situation and prevent further bloodshed. However, seeing that Russia supported Armenian forces during the war, together with its ally, Iran, there are valid concerns regarding the true objective and commitment of the Russian peacekeepers in maintaining Azerbaijani territorial integrity in Karabakh. A situation that can draw parallels with some of the Russian-backed separatist “autonomous republics”.\r\n\r\nOn 5th March, an Armenian vehicle, bearing Armenian license plates and police personnel from the separatist enclave in Karabakh, managed to “slip past” Russian peacekeeping checkpoints along the Lachin road, carrying weapons  on board. It was stopped by Azerbaijani troops, while moving along an unrecognised supply route into the separatist enclave. A shootout broke out and two Azerbaijani soldiers along with three people onboard the convoy were killed.\r\n\r\nThe Russian military was supposed to not let any weapons cross into the enclave. Yet after the shootout, pictures surfaced of the Armenian vehicle with visible military grade weapons hidden under seats in an attempt to smuggle them. A rearmament of separatists in Karabakh could lead to a grave escalation of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, from where the weapons shipments originated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, the Russian forces’ response to the incident was even faster than the Azerbaijani paramedics, sent to treat the wounded from the engagement. Russian reports on the incident were nowhere to be found, and no firefight was recorded to have occurred under the Russians’ watch.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising - as it turns out, another convoy with weapons and even military vehicles was spotted on Friday, 10 March, on the road to the enclave by the Azerbaijani military. However, this time it was accompanied by the Russian “peacekeepers”. \r\n\r\nMainstream media today dedicates much air time to covering the Georgian protests, and the threatening Russian response, due to the Georgian people’s fight for democracy and against Moscow’s influence in the country. Georgia is crucial to the West for other reasons as well. Primarily, Georgia connects Azerbaijan with Turkey and the Black Sea, meaning any exports from Azerbaijan, such as energy resources, can reach Europe. With the sanctions on Russia in effect, many European countries are looking for alternatives to Russian oil and gas. Luckily, Azerbaijan, with its vast resources in the Caspian Sea and access to Central Asian supply, can be that alternative. But for that to happen, Georgia is to remain a link in the supply route to Europe.\r\n\r\nEscalation in Karabakh due to Russian destabilisation efforts could lead to another round of fighting, hurting Azerbaijan’s trading with Europe through Georgia, which is why it is crucial to understand the situation in Karabakh as it is in reality. Support must be ensured for both the Georgian protests and the Azerbaijani struggle against the break away separatists on its territory. "],

You can unsubscribe at any time.\r\n\r\nSituated at the crossroads between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation, the Caucasus region is heavily influenced by these two regional superpowers - writes James Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani Foreign Ministers last week, intending to broker a lasting peace treaty between these two clashing countries. Many attempts to put the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict to rest have been made over the years, but this is the first time that US officials have taken an active part in the negotiations. It should come as no surprise that Blinken's decision to take a much more active part in the talks comes as a result of the increasing influence of other regional powers on the parties involved. This foreign influence also happens to have a distinct anti-Azerbaijani bias, as both Moscow and Tehran hold much against Baku. \r\n\r\nA focal point in the dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia is the Armenian-populated separatist exclave in the UN recognised territory of Azerbaijan, in the region of Karabakh. Since the 2020 war fought by Azerbaijan against Armenia over the Karabakh enclave, Russian peacekeepers have been deployed to the area to keep the peace and ensure the passage of goods from Armenia to the Karabakh Armenians and vice versa. But, the Russian forces on the ground soon found themselves pursuing different objectives than the ones stated in their official deployment.\r\n\r\nConsidering Russia’s previous, and still ongoing, conflicts regarding puppet territories in many different parts of the former Soviet Union, such as Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Donbass, Moscow is continuing according to the same playbook. Karabakh provides a fitting target for such an operation. Moscow already has a significant military presence in the region, under the guise of peacekeeping (and military bases in close proximity), and the population is vastly different from that of land owners.\r\n\r\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, «Putin is using the Armenians of Karabakh as pawns. Like the South Ossetians and Abkhazians in Georgia or the Russian communities in Ukraine, Karabakh offers him a pseudo-humanitarian justification for Russian imperialism». The separatist region in Karabakh, the so-called «Republic of Artsakh», is a mineral-rich region, which isn’t recognised by any political entity in the UN, including Armenia. However, it is a member of a group of unrecognised states that calls itself the «Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations» - an organisation whose only other members are puppet states created by Russia: South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, all these territories recognise each other and have a joint vested interest in being inducted into the Eurasian Union through their close ties to Russia. It is safe to assume that “Artsakh” will be no different, and will seek to ingratiate itself with Russia, the country which currently has the only deployed military force in the territories of this Armenian-populated enclave.\r\n\r\nArmenia itself is a close ally of both Russia and Iran, despite the large diaspora living in Western countries, especially in the US and in France. A recent report by The Guardian shows that Iranian drones of many types made their way into Russia using boats and Iranian state-owned airlines. An article by EU Reporter corroborates this, adding that Armenia plays an integral part in these deliveries, allowing Iranian cargo planes to land in its airports before proceeding to deliver weapons to the Russian forces in Ukraine. According to the Berlin-based «German Centre for the South Caucasus» Armenia is used by Russia as a proxy for imports to and exports from Russia. \r\n\r\nAt the same time Armenia tries to present itself as the «bastion of democracy in the Caucasus», calling through its English-language outlets to the West and international organisations to take practical steps to help them to fight against dictatorial Azerbaijan.  \r\n\r\nBut Armenia still remains a «textbook case of Eastern type autocracy, thinly covered with a veneer of modern values and civilisation», as the Romanian Newsweek edition puts it, bringing numerous proofs of alarming examples of oppression and tyranny.    \r\n\r\nSo while Yerevan tries to chum up to the West, yet its actions show where Yerevan’s allegiance truly lies. Whether current negotiations with Azerbaijan lead to any results, one should remain doubtful about their serious implementation because of the precedent Armenia has set for itself - siding with Russia and Iran on many issues. \r\n\r\nHere is one more recent example. Iranian officials have, more than once, declared how important their relations with Armenia are, claiming its territorial integrity and security are as crucial to Iran as Iran’s own. In late April flyers and leaflets appeared on residential and administrative buildings in Yerevan, including its central Republic Square, with a very clear message - images depicting the burning of Ukrainian, Israeli and Azerbaijani flags and the message in Armenian and Persian language “we have a common enemy”.\r\n\r\nOn 23rd April, during a torchlight procession in Yerevan marking the 108th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, an Azerbaijani flag was burned alongside the Turkish flag. A few days prior, on 14th April, Aram Nikolyan, an employee of the public TV of Armenia, snatched the Azerbaijani flag at the opening ceremony of the European Weightlifting Championship in Yerevan and burned it. Such evidence of the attitude in Armenia towards Azerbaijan and how the government doesn’t lift a finger to curb these open hostilities, raises doubts about the sincerity of negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was writing this article, I have come to learn that the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan plans to visit Moscow next week. Apparently he needs to report something to the Kremlin..."],

That makes getting several dozen world leaders in and out no easy task.  \r\n\r\nMoldova has closed its airspace for the duration of the summit and NATO surveillance planes will keep a watchful eye — a nod to the constant threat of Russian incursions. Access to the main airport has been restricted — a recognition of the myriad fake bomb alerts there since the start of the war. And most leaders won’t stay overnight — preferring to keep their visit to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe measures illustrate Europe’s daunting task as it tries to embrace a wider community of countries. The outreach inevitably involves wading directly into a sea of Russian menace — and overtures. \r\n\r\nMoldova, an ex-Soviet country of 2.6 million sandwiched between the EU and Ukraine, is a prime example. \r\n\r\nThe country has been trying to chart a path toward EU membership under pro-Western President Maia Sandu. But it is also battling multiple Russian threats — not only in the breakaway Transnistria region but also through a constant barrage of assaults on its democracy, energy supply and communications. Sandu even said Moldova had recently foiled a Russian-backed coup attempt.\r\n\r\nThat makes the summit location “a signal that Moldova matters,” Moldovan Foreign Minister told POLITICO ahead of the summit. It shows “that the whole Continent stands by Moldova and Ukraine in this difficult time in European history,” he added. \r\n\r\nRisk vs. Reward\r\nThursday’s one-day summit is the largest international event ever hosted by Moldova, which declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\r\n\r\nAccording to Anastasia Pociumban, a researcher for the German Council on Foreign Relations, the summit represents an “unprecedented” undertaking for the country. \r\n\r\n“It’s a challenge but it’s also a big opportunity to showcase Moldova. It’s a big stretch for the administration because the government is dealing with so many issues and crises at the same time,” Pociumban said. \r\n\r\nMoldova has gone beyond the usual security measures for the event — in part because of the country’s precarious geographical location, perched on the edge of the Black Sea, bordering Ukraine and with Russian soldiers stationed just 50 kilometers away from the capital. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoldva has been trying to chart a path toward EU membership under pro-Western President Maia Sandu | Pool photo by Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images\r\nIn addition to the aviation restrictions, the country is essentially locking in residents near Castle Mimi, a winery strategically chosen to host the summit 35 kilometers outside the capital, Chișinău. Locals have been asked to carry special permits to leave their homes while leaders are around and Moldovans have been given a public holiday.\r\n\r\nJournalists are also only permitted to travel to Castle Mimi on two specially chartered trains, leaving at 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. from the Chișinău central train station.\r\n\r\n“It’s an illustration of what Moldovans have to deal with every day, living under daily pressure from the Russians,” said Anne Genetet, a French lawmaker with the Renaissance party of French President Emmanuel Macron, an early advocate of the EPC. “The difficulties illustrate why it is so important to help them.”\r\n\r\nThe scale of the summit itself is also smaller than the inaugural European Political Community gathering in Prague last year. That’s partly due to security reasons, and partly the result of resource limitations. Some delegations are being forced to arrive on smaller jets than usual, for instance, because of the airport’s limited capacity (Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Wednesday canceled completely).\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, Western capitals and the EU have also been advising Moldova on everything from communication security to anti-corruption measures, according to Popescu and French officials. And France sent several delegations to Moldova to help with preparations, the Elysée said.\r\n\r\nStill, many of those involved in the preparations for the summit downplayed the security risks involved in holding the gathering. \r\n\r\n“There is a natural [level] of alert and a security observation, as with any summit, but with a particular attention given the region where [the summit] takes place,” said an Elysée official in a briefing with the press. “We have done what was needed to help the Moldavans to make the summit secure.”\r\n\r\nPopescu, too, noted that “hybrid attacks have intensified in the last year and a half” but insisted that Moldova “has been used to withstanding these kinds of pressures for many years.” \r\n\r\nFor the summit, he added, “We have been working closely with our partners to secure full-spectrum security for all of the leaders who will be on our soil. We’re very confident the summit will take place in a calm and secure atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nMoldova’s trajectory\r\nThe logistical difficulties involved in organizing the summit are, in some ways, a metaphor for the struggles Moldova has experienced on its path to possible EU membership. \r\n\r\nAfter years of inching along the road to EU accession, Moldova was formally granted candidate status alongside Ukraine last June. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, reaffirmed the country’s aspirations on Wednesday, speaking at the opening of a new EU civilian mission in Chișinău. The EU and Moldova are on the same page, he insisted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter years of inching along the road to EU accession, Moldova was formally granted candidate status alongside Ukraine last June | Elena Covalenco/AFP via Getty Images\r\nYet concerns remain about Moldova’s fitness for EU membership — not least its need to reform the judiciary and state institutions and fight corruption, priorities for Sandu since she was elected first as prime minister in 2019 and then as president the following year.\r\n\r\nThough Moldova wants accession talks to start by the end of the year, that might be an unrealistic timeline for some countries.\r\n\r\nBut some believe that Thursday’s summit may change minds. Notably, it will be the first time many of the leaders will have visited Moldova. \r\n\r\n“The summit may be an eye-opener,” said Vadim Pistrinciuc, a former member of the Moldovan parliament and government minister, now with the Institute for Strategic Initiatives (IPIS) “Ultimately the way Moldova — and, of course, Ukraine in particular — resisted the challenges of the past year or more has been revelatory. Many people were very pessimistic when Russia invaded.”\r\n\r\nMoldova is hoping that this undeniable goodwill will result in some deliverables from Thursday’s summit — perhaps including more pledges of energy cooperation between the EU and Moldova as the country continues to re-orientate its gas supply away from Russia.\r\n\r\nBrussels already moved to sanction the pro-Russian Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor this week — long a request of the Moldovan government. \r\n\r\nBut for the bigger question of EU membership, Moldova is unlikely to get the answer it wants on Thursday. That verdict may not come until December, when EU leaders will return to the tricky issue of membership status for Ukraine and Moldova."],

        "Russia will have until 15 August to cut its embassy personnel from more than 80 to 25, the foreign ministry said.",
        "“For many years we have been the object of hostile Russian actions and policies. Many of them were made through the embassy,” Popescu said.",
        "Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a weekly briefing that Moldova’s decision would “not go unanswered,” calling it “another step in the destruction of bilateral relations” between the countries.",
        "The Kremlin said it regretted Moldova’s decision and accused the country’s leadership of encouraging “Russophobia”.",
        "“Unfortunately, Chișinău is deliberately driving our relations into a very miserable state,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",

        "Russia’s ambassador to Moldova, Oleg Vasnetsov, said the embassy needed antennas because it was built at the end of the 1990s. “If telephony and internet worked well, there probably wouldn’t be a need for constant upgrades,” he said.",
